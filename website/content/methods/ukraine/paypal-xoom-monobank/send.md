# Sending using Xoom (a PayPal company), and Monobank

This method enables instant transfers that does not require visiting a physical bank. The first transfer will take about 30 minutes to complete. Subsequent transfers to the same person take 1-2 minutes. The transfer fees are low.

Once in Europe, the funds can be collected using "RIA" payment system in most banks. It is a bit confusing, because Xoom uses partnering organizations, but for some reason does not specify which one. It is "RIA" in Ukraine.

1. Collect information about your friend. Prefer to use a more secure communication channel. **All their information must be spelled with English characters.** You will require:
   - First and last name matching their ID document
   - Address
   - Phone number
2. Create a Xoom account. You may login with your PayPal account, if you already have one.
3. Add a new recipient. Make sure the correct country is selected. Fill in all the information about them.
4. Select currency USD and the amount to send. It is possible to use other currencies, but it may complicate some steps. USD is better for cross-border solvency and storage.
5. Send the transaction number to your friend.
6. Provide your friend with the following link, which contains instructions on how to receive the funds in Russian language: [{{< ref "receive.md" >}}]({{< ref "receive.md" >}})
