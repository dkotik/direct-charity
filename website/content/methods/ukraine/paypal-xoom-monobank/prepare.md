# Sending using Xoom (a PayPal company), and Monobank

This method enables instant transfers that does not require visiting a physical bank. The first transfer will take about 30 minutes to complete. Subsequent transfers to the same person take 1-2 minutes. The transfer fees are low. You can send no more than \$3,000 per month per recipient.

Once in Europe, the funds can be collected using "RIA" payment system in most banks. It is a bit confusing, because Xoom uses partnering organizations, but for some reason does not specify which one. It is "RIA" in Ukraine.

## Prepare

### Gather information

Prefer to use a more secure communication channel. **All their information must be spelled with English characters.** You will require:

1. First and last name matching their ID document
2. Address
3. Phone number

Here are information collection instructions in Russian that you can send to your Ukrainian friend:

```
Вам необходимо установить приложение "Монобанк." Нам нужны ваши данные набранные латинскими буквами: (1) имя и фамилия, (2) номер мобильного телефона, (3) адрес проживания.
```

### Setup Xoom account

Create a [Xoom account](https://xoom.com/). You may login using your PayPal account, if you already have one. Xoom is a PayPal company.
