# Transfer Funds

> Help, I am stuck at a gas station. I ran out of fuel and money. My city is under attack and I am trying to get away. It is getting dark. (Ukrainian friend)

You have a PayPal account, but you have no idea how to get some money to your friend. This website is a collection of guides for making fast money transfers for emergency situations in Ukraine. More countries may be added later. Evacuation? Medicine? Trauma? Finding a place to rest and shower?

You can rent an [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) for your friend remotely. Thanks to all of you who are already doing it! But, most people who had to suddenly flee need a little bit of cash on hand. At the very least, a little bit of cash in the right place and at the right time can provide a great relief.

## Best Methods

1. **PayPal** has recently dropped transfer fees and allowed Ukrainians to open an account using a mobile application and easily convert funds into local currency. Transfers are almost instant.
2. [Xoom/Monobank]({{< relref "ukraine/paypal-xoom-monobank/prepare.md" >}} "PayPal/Xoom/Monobank") is the fastest and most reliable method that does not require visiting a bank.
3. More will be added later... (in progress)

1. [Western Union](https://www.westernunion.com/us/en/home.html): surprisingly very slow right now with high fees.
