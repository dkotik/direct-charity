# Ship Parcel to Ukraine using Meest

## 1. Collect items

Warm children's clothing are frequently requested items. Used clothes are preferred. Meest asks **not** to mix used and new clothes in the same shipment. Raid your local Good Will! Please, select things of good quality. Natural fibers, **like wool and cotton**, have better thermal qualities than synthetic fibers, like polyester or nylon. Here is a basic set for children ages 3-16, a suggestion:

- warm hats
- warm scarves
- warm gloves
- warm socks
- warm jumpsuit/pants
- warm jacket
- warm shoes
- you are welcome to add other clothes if you want, for adults as well
- ... send more suggestions on Twitter to [@dkotik](https://twitter.com/dkotik)

## 2. Pack the box

1. Purchase at least 5x boxes, in 6,000-10,000 cubic inches capacity, aiming for ~65 pounds of weight. Some options:
    - [24-inch x 18-inch x 18-inch](https://www.amazon.com/Aviditi-241818-Corrugated-Length-Height/dp/B00BT4GAAU/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=24%2B18%2B18%2Bshipping%2Bbox&qid=1669241675&sprefix=24%2B18%2B18%2B%2Caps%2C88&sr=8-1&th=1)
    - [22-inch x 18-inch x 16-inch](https://www.amazon.com/22-Cardboard-Moving-Boxes-Corrugated/dp/B09NCFF45K/ref=sr_1_36?crid=1QOPE5RIQ9KXI&keywords=20x20x20+box&qid=1669234203&sprefix=20x20x20+box%2Caps%2C74&sr=8-36)
2. Tape the outside bottom of the box generously covering the middle seam completely.
3. Put a layer or two of cardboard on the inside bottom of the box. This greatly reduces the chance that the bottom may spill during delivery.
4. Make a list of every item being placed with exact amount.
5. If you are shipping clothes, use vacuum-seal to reduce the volume by 30-60%.
6. Fill the rest with lighter items or crumpled packing paper.
7. Do not seal the box.

## 3. Contact the recipient

Meest will only let you ship one box per unique recipient name. This has to do with additional customs scrutiny that they get on large shipments, making the cost of the delivery not worth it. Contact a partnering church in Ukraine and collect:

1. Their address, where you will ship the boxes.
2. A list of church members one per box you are about to ship. You must collect:
    1. **Their name in Latin characters as it appears in the passport**.
    2. **Their phone number with the area and country code**. (+380 is the country code for Ukraine)
3. If you do not have a partnering church, we can provide you with a contact.

## 4. Print the shipping label

1. Register at [Meest Portal](https://us.meest.com/portal)
2. Create “New Parcel”
3. Enter parcel details
    - Send no more than 66 lb per recipient.
    - For books, the best box dimensions are 16x16x16
4. Choose Fedex drop-off rates
    - Select shipping by sea (around ~$150) or air
    - Click “ship now”
5. Fill out sender’s & recipient’s information. If you are sending multiple boxes, they each should be addressed to a different person by name, although the destination address can be the same.
6. Fill out parcel items description
    - Value: $140. (Any amount over $150 will be taxed ~30%)
7. Sign & Pay.

You will receive a CN\# and a shipping number. Print both. For international shipping, **CN\# printout must be put inside the box for customs!** The shipping label goes on the outside.

## 5. Drop off

Make sure the total weight of the box is less than 66 pounds. You can weigh and seal it when you drop it off at a Fedex location.

Put CN\# inside the box. Take shipping label with you.
Take all of it to the nearest Fedex location. Give them the shipping label to attach to the outside of the box and ship.

## Notes

- We packed boxes at Fedex location, ours did it for free. It is helpful because they use scales to make sure the box is no heavier than 66 lb.
