# Ship Humanitarian Aid to Ukraine using Meest

## 1. Collect items

Warm children's clothing are frequently requested items. Used clothes are preferred. Meest asks **not** to mix used and new clothes in the same shipment. Raid your local Good Will! Please, select things of good quality. Natural fibers, **like wool and cotton**, have better thermal qualities than synthetic fibers, like polyester or nylon. Here is a basic set for children ages 3-16, a suggestion:

- warm hats
- warm scarves
- warm gloves
- warm socks
- warm jumpsuit/pants
- warm jacket
- warm shoes
- you are welcome to add other clothes if you want, for adults as well
- ... send more suggestions on Twitter to [@dkotik](https://twitter.com/dkotik)

## 2. Pack boxes

To qualify for “Meest Humanitarian Aid” rate, you will need to gather at least 200 pounds of things, ship as an organization, and your recipient should be an NGO. These 200 lb fill roughly 4 to 6 boxes of the following dimensions:

1. Purchase at least 5x boxes, in 6,000-10,000 cubic inches capacity, aiming for ~65 pounds of weight. Some options:
    - [24-inch x 18-inch x 18-inch](https://www.amazon.com/Aviditi-241818-Corrugated-Length-Height/dp/B00BT4GAAU/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=24%2B18%2B18%2Bshipping%2Bbox&qid=1669241675&sprefix=24%2B18%2B18%2B%2Caps%2C88&sr=8-1&th=1)
    - [22-inch x 18-inch x 16-inch](https://www.amazon.com/22-Cardboard-Moving-Boxes-Corrugated/dp/B09NCFF45K/ref=sr_1_36?crid=1QOPE5RIQ9KXI&keywords=20x20x20+box&qid=1669234203&sprefix=20x20x20+box%2Caps%2C74&sr=8-36)
2. Tape the outside bottom of the box generously covering the middle seam completely.
3. Put a layer or two of cardboard on the inside bottom of the box. This greatly reduces the chance that the bottom may spill during delivery.
4. Make a list of every item being placed with exact amount.
5. If you are shipping clothes, use vacuum-seal to reduce the volume by 30-60%.
6. Fill the rest with lighter items or crumpled packing paper.
7. Do not seal the box.
