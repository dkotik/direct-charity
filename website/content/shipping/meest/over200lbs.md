## 2. Pack boxes

To qualify for "Meest Humanitarian Aid" rate, you will need to gather 200 pounds of things. They fill roughly 4 to 6 boxes of the following dimensions:

1. Purchase at least 5x boxes, in 6,000-10,000 cubic inches capacity, aiming for ~65 pounds of weight. Some options:
    - [24-inch x 18-inch x 18-inch](https://www.amazon.com/10-Premium-Moving-Boxes-Cardboard/dp/B007PBKWDC/ref=sr_1_2?crid=1CB1O8M74WPRJ&keywords=24x18x18+box&qid=1669234162&sprefix=24x18x18+box%2Caps%2C76&sr=8-2)
    - [22-inch x 18-inch x 16-inch](https://www.amazon.com/22-Cardboard-Moving-Boxes-Corrugated/dp/B09NCFF45K/ref=sr_1_36?crid=1QOPE5RIQ9KXI&keywords=20x20x20+box&qid=1669234203&sprefix=20x20x20+box%2Caps%2C74&sr=8-36)
2. Tape the outside bottom of the box generously covering the middle seam completely.
3. Put a layer or two of cardboard on the inside bottom of the box. This greatly reduces the chance that the bottom may spill during delivery.
4. Make a list of every item being placed with exact amount.
5. If you are shipping clothes, use vacuum-seal to reduce the volume by 30-60%.
6. Fill the rest of lighter items or crumped packing paper.
7. Do not seal the box.

## 3. Contact Meest to arrange pick up

Shipping 200+ pounds requires a few additional steps. You will need to fill out a form and wait for Meest customer support to reply to you.
