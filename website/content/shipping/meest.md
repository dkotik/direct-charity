# How to send a parcel from the USA to Ukraine through Meest

## 1. Collect items

Warm children's clothing are frequently requested items. Natural fibers, **like wool and cotton**, have better thermal qualities than synthetic fibers, like polyester or nylon. Some ideas:

- [$20 Set of wool toddler hats and a pair of gloves](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09D2GDGFG/ "Didida Soft Warm Knitted Baby Hats Infant Toddler Baby Beanies Baby Winter Wool Hats")
- [$30 pack of Two 55% Cotton girl sweater](https://www.amazon.com/Simple-Joys-Carters-Cardigan-Sweaters/dp/B0797MRBKG/ "Simple Joys by Carter's Baby Girls' Knit Cardigan Sweaters, Pack of 2")

## 2. Pack the box

1. Use [box size 16x16x16](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01D37HO28/ "BOX USA Moving Boxes 16L x 16W x 16H Cube 25-Pack | Corrugated Cardboard Box for Packing, Moving and Storage 16x16x16 161616") inches aiming for under 66 pounds weight.
2. Tape the outside bottom of the box generously covering the middle seam completely.
3. Put a layer or two of cardboard on the inside bottom of the box. This greatly reduces the chance that the bottom may spill during delivery.
4. Make a list of every item being placed with exact amount.
5. If you are shipping clothes, use vacuum-seal to reduce the volume by 30-60%.
6. Heavier items like books will pack to ~80% of the volume. Fill the rest of lighter items or crumped packing paper.
7. Do not seal the box.

## 3. Contact recipient

Meest will only let you ship one box per unique recipient name. This has to do with additional customs scrutiny that they get on large shipments, making the cost of the delivery not worth it. Contact a partnering church in Ukraine and collect:

1. Their address, where you will ship the boxes.
2. A list of church member names and their phone numbers, one per box you are about to ship.
3. If you do not have a partnering church, we can provide you with a contact.

## 4. Print the shipping label

1. Register at [Meest Portal](https://us.meest.com/portal)
2. Create “New Parcel”
3. Enter parcel details
    - Send no more than 66 lb per recipient.
    - For books, the best box dimensions are 16x16x16
4. Choose Fedex drop-off rates
    - Select shipping by sea (around ~$150) or air
    - Click “ship now”
5. Fill out sender’s & recipient’s information. If you are sending multiple boxes, they each should be addressed to a different person by name, although the destination address can be the same.
6. Fill out parcel items description
    - Value: $140. (Any amount over $150 will be taxed ~30%)
7. Sign & Pay.

You will receive a CN\# and a shipping number. Print both. For international shipping, **CN\# printout must be put inside the box for customs!** The shipping label goes on the outside.

## 5. Drop off

Make sure the total weight of the box is less than 66 pounds. You can weigh and seal it when you drop it off at a Fedex location.

Put CN\# inside the box. Take shipping label with you.
Take all of it to the nearest Fedex location. Give them the shipping label to attach to the outside of the box and ship.

## Notes

- We packed boxes at Fedex location, ours did it for free. It is helpful because they use scales to make sure the box is no heavier than 66 lb.
