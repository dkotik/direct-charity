You will receive a CN\# and a shipping number. Print both. For international shipping, **CN\# printout must be put inside the box for customs!**

Pack box & put CN\# inside the box. Take shipping label with you.
Take all of it to the nearest Fedex location. Give them the shipping label to attach to the outside of the box and ship.

## Notes

- We packed boxes at Fedex location, they do it for free. It is helpful because they use scales to make sure the box is no heavier than 66 lb.
