# Direct Charity

> Help, I am stuck at a gas station. I ran out of fuel and money. My city is under attack and I am trying to get away. It is getting dark. (Ukrainian friend)

You have a PayPal account, but you have no idea how to get your money to them. This website is a collection of guides for making fast money transfers for emergency situations in Ukraine. More countries may be added later. Evacuation? Medicine? Trauma? Finding a place to rest and shower?

You can rent an [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com/) for your friend remotely. Thanks to all of you who are already doing it! But, most people who had to suddenly flee need a little bit of cash on hand. At the very least, cash in the right place and at the right time can provide a great relief even with a tiny amount.

View the guides here: <https://dkotik.github.io/direct-charity/>. Beware of scammers! Use those methods only with people you know. You should also check if the recipient is subject to sanctions by using [this search engine](https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/).
